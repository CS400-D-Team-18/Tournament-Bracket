# The GUI
Submit a program that displays a GUI that shows the initial view that the user will see for your program.
The UI does not have to function.  It just has to show up and show the user interface the user will see at the start.  It can use hard-coded values for any data that will eventually be read or generated.   Be sure to include labels, status messages, and or instructions to the user as may be required.

Points will be awarded based on [Nielsen's](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) Links to an external site.  

Since full functionality is not yet required, we will focus on aesthetic and completeness at the start.
